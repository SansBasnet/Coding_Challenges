**Statement**:

The goal is to find, when they exist, the horizontal and vertical neighbors nodes from a two dimensional array. The difficulty is in the number of nested loops that this puzzle can make you write. Do not get lost!

This one is not as old as the others, it was written about a year ago sometime after I first started using C#. However, I'll see how I can improve it anyways.
